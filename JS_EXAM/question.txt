Project Title : Task Manager

Project Objective :

​

​The objective of this project is to develop a Task Management System that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of tasks. The project will also incorporate a priority-based filter feature to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently.



Project Requirements :

​

​1. HTML Structure (5 points) :

​- Create an HTML file with a clean and organized structure for the task management system. - Include an input form to add new tasks and a dynamic list to display existing tasks.

​- Fields for each task should include title, description, due date, and priority(low,medium,high).



​2. Adding Tasks (5 points) :

​​- Implement a function (`addTask`) to collect information from users when adding a new task. - Validate that the task title and due date are provided before adding a task.

​- Format the task data and add it to the task list dynamically.



​3. Displaying Tasks (5 points) :

​- Create a function (`displayTasks`) to display tasks on the page dynamically. - Display each task with its title, description, due date, and priority.



​4. Local Storage (10 points) :

​- Utilize local storage to persist task data even when the page is refreshed.

​- Implement functions to load task data from local storage on page load and save data when tasks are added or modified.



​5. Editing Tasks (5 points) :

​​- Develop a function (`editTask`) to allow users to edit existing tasks. - Identify a unique identifier for each task to ensure accurate editing.



​6. Deleting Tasks (5 points) :

​- Implement a function (`deleteTask`) to allow users to remove tasks from the list. - Update the page dynamically when a task is deleted.



​7. Priority-based filter (10 points) :

​- Add a filter feature based on task priority, allowing users to view tasks - searching feature



​8. User Interaction (5 points) :

​- Ensure that input fields are cleared after successfully adding or editing a task. - Implement a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing tasks.
